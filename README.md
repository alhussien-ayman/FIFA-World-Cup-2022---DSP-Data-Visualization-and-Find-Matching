2. Click **Find Similar Plays (DTW)**
3. View results ranked by spatial and temporal similarity
4. Compare ball movements and player formations

**TF-IDF Search (Semantic Similarity)**
1. Select a goal sequence or play
2. Click **Find Similar Plays (TF-IDF)**
3. View results ranked by event type and tactical patterns
4. Analyze similar play structures

## 🔧 How It Works

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Loading & Caching**
   - Singleton DataLoader loads JSON files into memory
   - High-performance caching for instant access
   - Normalized data structures for efficient querying

2. **Goal Sequence Extraction**
   - Identifies goal events in match timeline
   - Extracts preceding events (typically 5-10 events)
   - Captures spatial and temporal context
   - Associates player and team information

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - **Spatial Features**: Ball coordinates, player positions, formations
   - **Temporal Features**: Event timing, sequence duration
   - **Semantic Features**: Event types, outcomes, pitch zones
   - **Tactical Features**: Pass types, pressure levels, player roles

4. **Similarity Algorithms**

   **DTW (Dynamic Time Warping)**
   - Calculates Euclidean distance between ball positions
   - Applies event type penalties for mismatches
   - Analyzes player formation similarity
   - Uses FastDTW for optimized performance
   - Returns normalized distance scores

   **TF-IDF Semantic Search**
   - Converts plays into "sentences" of events
   - Maps coordinates to pitch zone descriptors
   - Vectorizes event sequences using scikit-learn
   - Calculates cosine similarity between plays
   - Returns semantic similarity scores

   **Hybrid Search**
   - Combines DTW and TF-IDF scores
   - Weighted scoring system (configurable)
   - Normalizes results across both algorithms
   - Returns comprehensive similarity rankings

5. **Visualization**
   - Renders plays on interactive pitch canvas
   - Displays player formations and movements
   - Shows ball trajectory and event markers
   - Real-time updates with smooth animations

### Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **DSP Algorithms**: FastDTW, NumPy, SciPy
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn (TF-IDF Vectorization)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas
- **Data Format**: JSON
- **Visualization**: Custom pitch.js rendering engine

## 🎓 Technical Deep Dive

### DTW Implementation Details

The Dynamic Time Warping algorithm compares sequences by:

1. **Ball Position Similarity**
   - Euclidean distance: `√((x₁-x₂)² + (y₁-y₂)²)`
   - Normalized to pitch dimensions (0-100 scale)

2. **Event Type Matching**
   - Penalty system for mismatched events
   - Event groups: Pass, Cross, Clearance, Shot, etc.
   - Configurable penalty weights

3. **Formation Analysis**
   - K-nearest neighbors algorithm
   - Average player distance calculations
   - Spatial density metrics

4. **Path Alignment**
   - FastDTW optimization for O(N) complexity
   - Dynamic programming approach
   - Warping path visualization

### TF-IDF Implementation Details

The semantic search system works by:

1. **Document Creation**
   - Each play = one document
   - Events concatenated into sequences
   - Pitch zones mapped to descriptors

2. **Vectorization**
   - TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn
   - N-gram analysis (1-3 grams)
   - Term frequency normalization

3. **Similarity Calculation**
   - Cosine similarity between vectors
   - Range: 0 (completely different) to 1 (identical)
   - Ranked by descending similarity

4. **Zone Mapping**
   ```
   Pitch divided into 9 zones:
   - def_left, def_center, def_right
   - mid_left, mid_center, mid_right
   - att_left, att_center, att_right
   ```
